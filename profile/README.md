### Open-source firmware sponsorship announcement

> **NOTE**: following message is from [3mdeb Team](https://github.com/3mdeb) which
> between February 2016 and September 2022 was officially responsible for
> maintaining PC Engines organization on Github as well as [firmware distribution website](https://pcengines.github.io) 
> and [forum](https://forum.pcengines.dev) on behalf of PC Engines. 

We regret to announce that PC Engines, a provider of small and low-power
servers for network security, wireless networking, and embedded applications,
has discontinued its sponsorship for open-source firmware. Although this is a
significant change for the open-source firmware community, our commitment to
supporting the hardware remains strong. At [Dasharo](https://dasharo.com), we
aim to continue the legacy of PC Engines by distributing open-source firmware
and putting the community's needs first. Our focus will be on releases and
feature sets driven by community support. We are considering a subscription
model to ensure stable and reliable firmware updates. Your input is important
to us, and we would appreciate your feedback through our
[survey](https://forms.gle/MHrT2f1du1Afvwvj9). Please help us understand how we
can better serve the open-source firmware community and ensure its success in
the future.
